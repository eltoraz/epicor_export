Set all Inventor clients to use networked Design Data & external rule directories:
- move Design Data folder to network, configure clients to point to new location
  - see: https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/inventor-products/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/Inventor-Help/files/GUID-35327F99-72FC-4154-BFB0-6E46E20B9E76-htm.html
  - default directory: C:\Users\Public\Documents\Autodesk\Inventor 2016\Design Data\iLogic\UI
- add rule folders to External Rule Directories in Tools>Options>iLogic Configuration (in dropdown)
  - iLogic config file located at %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Inventor 2016\iLogicPreferences
  - simple XML file with contents of that options dialog, so can configure on one machine and copy the file to the others

note: raw materials still get added AND updated through Inventor, so need to call DMT with -Add and -Update flag for "Material" parts

expand process to include Quoting spreadsheet generation (see example in N:\CompanyResources\Quoting\Rejuvenation\Island Collection\RM Spreadsheets)
  - need to figure out how this is going to be generated & populated
  - IIRC, generation will be done beforehand, and the user will select the spreadsheet to work with
