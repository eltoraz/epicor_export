- move Design Data folder to network, configure clients to point to new location
  - see: https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/inventor-products/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/Inventor-Help/files/GUID-35327F99-72FC-4154-BFB0-6E46E20B9E76-htm.html
  - default directory: C:\Users\Public\Documents\Autodesk\Inventor 2016\Design Data\iLogic\UI
- add I:\Cadd\_iLogic\Export to External Rule Directories in Tools>Options>iLogic Configuration (in dropdown) for all Inventor installations

- troubleshoot 60partplant_export not adding serial numbers even though the conditions evaluate true
- need to update process - using part numbers from species population (i.e., the Part Custom iProperties); the Part Number Project iProperty will just be the drawing number
- will need to add a part for both the actual part and the raw material (user-input in the species selection process)
- export logic - Inventor export will only be used to initially populate Epicor with a part, not for future revisions - so check whether the part already exists in the DB and abort if so
  - raw materials still get added AND updated through Inventor

- expand process to include Quoting spreadsheet generation (see example in N:\CompanyResources\Quoting\Rejuvenation\Island Collection\RM Spreadsheets)

- validate data input in form in 21...
  - test that DMT accepts CSVs containing escaped commas & quotes (and write appropriate substitution code if so)
